    "comments": "My favorite part of Christmas is how, unequaled in any other holiday, you are able to remember the years past. It’s so close to New Years, it is almost an opportunity to sum up the year, and remember what has happened before. But I also think this is simply a part of the season. It is, in it’s definition, a season of remembrance. Beyond the memories of family, past giving and receiving, and overwhelming amounts of meat, we remember how Jesus came to this earth those millennia ago. Christmas, in it’s essence, is about remembering what has happened.\nThe Bible has much to say about remembering. For instance, so many times in the old testament, both God and His servants would speak of “remembering,” before something even happened, so that when it did happen, it would be that much more significant. “Remember” when you enter the promise land, “remember” when my temple is built, and do not forget what the Lord has done for you. The power of prophecy is not only for keeping on the lookout, but for an event to be even more significant when it happens.\nProphecy, historically, has been most important for those who hear of it afterward, rather than beforehand. Few people, in Jesus' time, believed in Jesus because of the prophecies spoken of Him. Even after how many hundreds of miracles, Jesus has only 500 or so documented followers by the time of his resurrection (1 Corinthians 15:3-6). Whereas, we see in the first great sermon after his resurrection, through Peter speaking of the scriptures that foretold of the Messiah, we see 3,000 come to believe in Him. How many more have used the scriptures written hundreds of years before they were realized to find truth.\nIn fact, it seems that Isaiah was trying to point to specific points in this story. He explains the fall, sacrifice, and redemption of mankind: the falling of mankind has been from the beginning, but Isaiah speaks to it currently, and how the Messiah is to come into a broken world, that is in need of redemption. With this He foreshadows the largest point: that the Messiah will be broken for the broken; he will sacrifice himself for those who are guilty. He also points to the glorious response, and not only the salvation, but also the glorification, to come as a result of His sacrifice. Lined throughout Isaiah's book is the foreshadowing of redemption, where the Messiah is judged for the guilty, and thus glorified.\nSo what does this have to do with us, and why not just read the actual story of Jesus? I would submit that the prophecies of the old testament puts just as much weight to this Christmas season as the Christmas story itself: since this becomes no longer a nice story that happened, but an event long awaited; a hope fulfilled. And it helps us as well, as we look to hope as well: we have a hoped fulfilled that we remember, and we can thus hope in the future glory that awaits us. Christmas is a time to look both back and forth: We are to remember the great fulfillment of history, and in this have hope, that Jesus is who He said He is, and that He, “is with [us] always, even to the end of the age.”"

    "comments": "John the Baptist's birth was like his ministry - surprising and full of disruption. As a prophet, he will don the clothing that reflects his impassioned infilling by the Holy Spirit and commitment to the Holy Spirit. He will be a Nazarite. He will come out of the hard, bare place of the wilderness wearing camel's hair, a leather belt, and the locust-and-honey breath that could lay waste to a whole host of sins. He will begin his most famous sermon with the lovely pastoral phrase: \"You brood of vipers....!\" (I have never been able to pull that one off!)\nAnd so it is with his birth. His mother Elizabeth is beginning to despair of the greatest blessing that she longs for - to bear a child. And to make matters more fraught, Elizabeth and her husband Zechariah have been good! His mother and father are \"righteous before God, living blamelessly according to all the commandments and regulations of the Lord.\" Then the Biblical writing adds, like a punch line, \"But they had no children.\" \"But they had no children\" is the line that tells us that children are the just reward of the righteous in the order of things. Good things come to those who fear the Lord! So where is our child? The seeds of the shake-up are already planted in this tension. Righteous living has not been met with its reward.\nNow the angel Gabriel arrives with news. Messages from God can be overwhelming in the best of circumstances. Sometimes they are downright terrifying, even when the news is good. Because so often the news comes in a way we don't expect, or from the side, or it's not exactly the news we wanted. But most of all, God's news comes to us as thoroughgoing transformation. That's just going to happen. And we can feel it in our bones when that's the news we are about to receive.\nSo with Zechariah. He was doing his good work in the temple. In his heart, he had despaired of the longed-for child. But he is a faithful member of the community. So he's carrying on with the good work. And Gabriel arrives, like a train in the dark, like a light in the cellar, like a hundred birds flushing up from a nearby tree, like a whistle from a stranger across the field. Gabriel! Messenger of God! And it's good news. \"Your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you will name him John. You will have joy and gladness....\"\nWell..., it was good news. It was amazing news. It was too much good news. Zechariah, his aging heart aching, couldn't take it in. \"How will I know that this is so?\" Good old Zechariah asks for the proof. And Gabriel is not amused. You'll get your proof, my friend. And also, you're not going to be able to speak until the child is born. How's that for some divine evidence! (Gabriel is a serious messenger used to dealing in the most sensitive and important of heavenly matters.)\nAnd so the blessing came to Elizabeth and Zechariah, but not in the way they expected. It was God's own blessing, not offered by human dictates or plans. And so arrived John the Baptist, who preached repentance, and the coming of fire, and practicing the ritual of baptism in water. It was John who recognized Jesus as the Christ, and John who baptized him. And so John offered great change to the people, and Jesus completed the change. Now it would be \"good news of great joy to all people.\" Now it would God's love most amazing, offered for all the world, for all eternity. \"You will have joy and gladness....\""

    "comments": "We don’t know a whole lot about Mary, mother of Jesus.\nMary was young, a virgin, a good and devout Jew.\nThere is a tendency to think that she must have been immaculate to be chosen by God- but we know by\nthe other people in the Bible that God had chosen that this isn’t necessarily so. And in fact, there is only\none sinless human to ever walk the earth and that was Jesus, the Son of God. It is likely that, like Esther,\nMary was created “for such a time as this,” but God still needed her to be willing for His plan to move\nforward.\nShe risked a lot by saying yes to God. At this time in history, it was still Hebraic law to stone adulterers to\ndeath. Even if she were protected from this, her pregnancy would alienate her from her community, and\nbring shame upon her and her family. There was also the very real possibility that upon hearing of her\npregnancy, Joseph would reject her- leaving her a single mother in a world that would have little\ncompassion on her.\nThere were roughly 400 years between the last prophet of the Old Testament (Malachi) and the angel\nspeaking to Mary. What must it have been like for her to grow up knowing the old prophets, but not\ncurrently have anyone to speak on God’s behalf. To be waiting under the oppression of the Roman\nEmpire for a messiah to set the world straight, and then to be told that YOU will bear and raise that\nmessiah! She was probably familiar with Isaiah 7:14. But knowing a prophecy and being the object of a\nprophecy are two very different things!\nI like to think that if I were in her shoes, I would be able to say yes and amen to God as quickly and\n(seemingly) easily as Mary did, but I’ve seen how I respond to God when He puts things in front of me\nthat I don’t understand and don’t feel up to. I am more like Zachariah, father of John the Baptist, who\nrequired proof that God would do what He said He would. I’ve always found it interesting that\nZachariah, a priest who spent time in the Holy of Holies- the very Presence of the Most High God- would\nquestion God, but the young virgin girl would take Him at His word. I have a great admiration for Mary\nand the strength that she possessed.\nIt must have taken a huge amount of faith to accept her role as the Mother of the Messiah. She had to\nhave a firm grasp on the Heart of God- that He would take care of her and see her through the trials she\nknew she would face. Because despite everything, she accepted the role God had for her and submitted\nherself to His will.\nMary, whom the angel called blessed and highly favored, the mother of the savior of mankind, humbled\nherself before God and called herself His servant.\nI pray that this Christmas season we can follow Mary’s example by trusting in God wholeheartedly, and\nsaying yes to His plans for us.\n\",http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0895/0864/products/1629957_600x.jpeg?v=1453543279 ,\"Arthur Hacker, \"The Annunciation\" (1892)"

It has been set hundreds of times to different music and is one of the texts that is read every three years in the revised common lectionary that many churches use to choose their texts for Sunday worship.  \nBoth the Magnificat in Luke 39 and the Prayer of Hannah in 1 Samuel 2, feature unlikely women characters, praising God for essentially overturning the societal norms of the time.  Ideas like feeding the hungry, lifting up the poor and lowly and showing mercy to those who honor God are prevalent in both of their passages.  The ones who are highlighted here, the ones who are in need, are the ones that had “no room” in a society that didn’t value them.  These ideas also foreshadow the teachings of Jesus, who was among those who were told that there was “no room.”\nWho are the folks in our society today that are being told there is “no room”?  Who are the hungry, the poor, the lowly in our society?  Who are the ones that Jesus would make room for?  I’ll finish with a poem by Brian Bilston:\nREFUGEES\nThey have no need of our help\nSo do not tell me\nThese haggard faces could belong to you or me\nShould life have dealt a different hand\nWe need to see them for who they really are\nChancers and scroungers\nLayabouts and loungers\nWith bombs up their sleeves\nCut-throats and thieves\nThey are not\nWelcome here\nWe should make them\nGo back to where they came from\nThey cannot\nShare our food\nShare our homes\nShare our countries\nInstead let us\nBuild a wall to keep them out\nIt is not okay to say\nThese are people just like us\nA place should only belong to those who are born there\nDo not be so stupid to think that\nThe world can be looked at another way\n(now read from bottom to top)"

    "comments": "As an Episcopalian, liturgy is very important to me.  So I was excited when the text I was assigned to reflect upon is one which figures prominently in our daily office of morning prayer.  The Song of Zechariah is read by many worldwide each morning. It becomes even more appropriate as we move through the liturgical season of Advent (the four weeks before Christmas).  \nJohn the Baptist is an important figure in the season of Advent. He stands in the wilderness calling for repentance, making a way for the coming of the Lord.  The story of his birth paired alongside Jesus’ birth paints a picture of God’s unwavering dream for humanity in the face of difficult odds.  John’s father Zechariah is literally struck dumb after hearing the news that his wife will bear a son.  They were both advanced in age, and he simply didn’t believe that such a thing was possible.  He was not allowed to speak until he wrote the words which essentially signified his agreement with the good news.  As soon as he feverishly scribbled, “His name is John,” Zechariah broke out into a poetic outburst.  A song.\n“Praise be to the Lord, the God of Israel,\n    because he has come to his people and redeemed them.\n He has raised up a horn[c] of salvation for us\n    in the house of his servant David\n (as he said through his holy prophets of long ago),\n salvation from our enemies\n    and from the hand of all who hate us—\n   to show mercy to our ancestors\n    and to remember his holy covenant,\n     the oath he swore to our father Abraham:\n    to rescue us from the hand of our enemies,\n    and to enable us to serve him without fear\n     in holiness and righteousness before him all our days.\n   And you, my child, will be called a prophet of the Most High;\n    for you will go on before the Lord to prepare the way for him,\n   to give his people the knowledge of salvation\n    through the forgiveness of their sins,\n   because of the tender mercy of our God,\n    by which the rising sun will come to us from heaven\n   to shine on those living in darkness\n    and in the shadow of death,\nto guide our feet into the path of peace.”\nWe find ourselves in that silent reflective time, a wilderness time in Advent.  Unable to speak, afraid to speak, waiting expectantly with a left hand full of doubt and a right hand open to receive the secret mystery too wonderful to cross our lips. At our best we are mulling over that first part of Zechariah’s song, knowing and counting the ways in which God has made God’s self known to us in the past. Recalling the stories and promises handed down by grandmothers and Sunday school teachers, lived out with fear and trembling.\nThe invitation of Advent, looking back at Christ’s coming in flesh to live and die as one of us, is really an invitation to let go of what we think we know.  We are waiting.  But the kind of waiting we are called to is a present tense Hallelujah.  \nIt is hard to live in an in-between time.  But that middle point between thanksgiving and hope for a future so wonderful that we can neither ask for nor imagine, that point when our mouth finally is opened, that point when the first peaceful, prophetic word slips out— That is precisely the moment when Christ comes into the world.  And Christ comes into the world every day, not just in the bleak midwinter.  Christ comes in that present tense Hallelujah, breaking out into the future where the buds of expectant possibility bloom out into the Kingdom of God."

    "comments": "In the first chapter of the gospel of Matthew, we encounter a young woman by the name of Mary and the man to whom she is to be married, Joseph. Two young Jewish teenagers trying their best to grow up and live holy lives, as Yahweh would have them do. But then the unexpected happened; indeed, the seemingly impossible happened. An angel visited Joseph in a dream and told him that Mary was pregnant (news to Joseph considering that they had not had sexual relations). But it was not that she was simply pregnant, she was pregnant with the Son of God.\n        Verse twenty-three of the first chapter of Matthew tells us that the angel instructed Joseph to name the little boy “Immanuel,” which means “God with us.” This is what theologians call the incarnation. It is the awe-inspiring moment when the God of the universe chose to cloak himself in human flesh and become like one of us. You could say, then, that Jesus is the greatest missionary who ever lived. For he left his proper dwelling in Heaven to come dwell among a people who were very much different than he; they were besot by sin, and they were selfish to the core.\n        Jesus became like us in our human nature, so that he could save us from ourselves. In fact, this was his plan all along. We learn about this plan hatched in eternity past way back in the third chapter of the book of Genesis. The fifteenth verse says, “I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your offspring and her offspring; he shall bruise your head, and you shall bruise his heel.” This was God speaking to the Devil in the Garden of Eden. And the offspring of woman that would one day crush the head of the Devil is Jesus. What does all of this mean, then?\n        It means so many things. It means that Jesus was not some sort of panic induced, half baked plan that the Trinity came up with; it means that God knew all along that he would send his Son to be born of a virgin in order to save his people. It also means that God is always in control even though at times it seems as if the Devil is winning. God knew man would sin, which is why he planned from long ago to save the world through his Son. Finally, this story of the incarnation means that God loves us. His love for us is proven in that he sent his Son to be born on this sin-saturated earth for the sole purpose of dying for our sins. This is true love. It was Jesus who said that greater love hath no man than this that he would lay down his life for his friends. Jesus, then, is the greatest of friends. And his friendship with us began so long ago when he was born to two humble teenagers."

    "comments": "“I will indeed bless you, and I will make your offspring as numerous as the stars of heaven and as the sand that is on the seashore … and by your offspring shall all the nations of the earth gain blessing for themselves, because you have obeyed my voice.\" Genesis 22:17-18\nAbraham had a strange relationship with the LORD.  Throughout his life, Abraham—formerly called Abram—struggled with listening to and believing the word of the LORD.  When he was told that his wife, Sarah, would bear a son, Abraham and Sarah both were in disbelief.  They were in such disbelief that they decided Abraham would father a child with Sarah’s servant, Hagar. Still, despite Abraham and Sarah’s lack of faith, the LORD was faithful and Sarah bore Abraham a child, Isaac.  These verses from Genesis come after that.  Here, Abraham was commanded to sacrifice Isaac.  This time, Abraham listens to the LORD until this angel of the LORD tells him to stop. In that moment, the LORD promises Abraham more than many sons.  The LORD promises that all the nations of the earth will be blessed by Abraham’s descendants.\nThis changes everything.  For some time—for all of time—the stories of Hebrew faith have been for the Hebrews, for God’s chosen people.  This changes everything because, suddenly, somehow, God’s story becomes the story for the world.\nThe gospel of Matthew records the generations from Abraham to Jesus, and it’s really kind of a boring list to read. The shortened list traces: Abraham to Isaac to Jacob to Judah (and Tamar) to Perez to Hezron to Aram to Aminadab to Nahshon to Salmon (and Rahab) to Boaz (and Ruth) to Obed to Jesse to David (and Bathsheba) to Solomon to Rehoboam to Abijah to Asaph to Jehoshaphat to Joram to Uzziah to Jotham to Ahaz to Hezekiah to Manasseh to Amos to Josiah to Jechoniah to Salathiel to Zerubbabel to Abiud to Eliakim to Azor to Zadok to Achim to Eliud to Eleazar to Matthan to Jacob to Joseph, the husband of Mary of whom Jesus was born.  At a glance, one can see that Matthew’s intent is to trace the lineage of Jesus to the line of King David and farther back to the child of Abraham.  Jesus’ Hebrew heritage is important.\nBut, Matthew’s list is hinged on some less-than-admirable people. Do you remember Abraham’s story?  He struggled to remain faithful to God, but that time he was faithful to God was when he almost sacrificed his son.  Remember King David?  He fathered his son, Soloman, by Bathsheba, and he knew she was the wife of Uriah.  King David even had Uriah sent to battle to die.  These guys weren’t the most moral, upright, honest, hard-working men.  \nFurthermore, Matthew’s list of ancestors includes women. Dr. Duane A. Priebe notes, “It is unusual that four women are mentioned in this ancient genealogy, along with Mary, the mother of Jesus (1:16). Tamar had twins by her father-in-law (Gen 38). Rahab was a Canaanite prostitute who helped the Israelite spies in Jericho (Josh 2). Ruth, a Moabite, was a model of faithfulness and married into the Jewish people (Ruth). David committed adultery with Uriah’s wife, Bathsheba, and had Uriah murdered (2 Sam 11-12).”  It seems that the most upstanding character in the lineage of Jesus is not even a Hebrew by birth.  Why would Matthew—who, for prophecy sake—establishes a line for the Messiah through David and Abraham, why would Matthew list all of these other people who seem to draw away from a righteous, kingly, Hebrew heritage?\nBecause the words of the angel to Abraham (forty some generations prior) did change everything.  This story of Jesus goes deeper than a list of names and a proper family tree.  The Messiah comes from faithful and faithless people, the Messiah comes from strong and broken people, the Messiah comes from men and women.  Regardless of the people involved and regardless of what we might think of them, the Messiah comes from all kinds of people to bless the people of all nations.  This story gives us scandalous, unbelievable, word of hope for this season: If the Messiah, Immanuel, God with us, can come to the world through those people, then God just might come into the world with us, too."

    "comments": "Everyone of us has an origin story. \nWe are individuals that come from a family that has come from somewhere.  We carry the DNA of generations.  We embody the values of what we have been taught.  We respond to the experiences of life.  We are formed by nature and nurture, as the psychologists would say.  \nAs for me, I am the youngest of six children, born of a man who married late in life, after serving in World War II, and a woman who epitomized grace, love, and the perfect homemaker.  I grew up in Southern California with older siblings who were everything from rebellious hippies to soldiers, free spirits to driven students.  Growing up, I watched the Partridge Family, Happy Days, Mash, and Cheers.  From this bit of information about my origins, you can probably guess a few things about me.\nJesus has an origin story, too.  Jesus was born of a young woman around whom scandal swirled.  While betrothed, she was found to be with child.  Grounds for stoning in Jesus’ time.  Little is known about Mary.  We know that she said “yes” when God asked her to do the impossible, and bear the Son of God.  Her origins must have grounded her in a very strong faith, in a deep and abiding trust in God, in an unwavering insistence on hope.  Mary said, “Yes,” and sang a song, and dreamt of the day when those who would cast judgment on others through power and might be shaken from the core of their arrogance, dreamt of the day when no one would lack respect or food, dreamt of the day when all might know the mercy of God and offer it to others.  As she sings, I imagine Mary holding her womb for these dreams were for her son.  Her dreams are of her son.  This is from whom Jesus is born.  This is how Jesus was shaped.\nMary’s dream had context.  It surely was born from her people’s remembrance of God’s promise of a holy and just land, the remembrance of a mighty king who was not perfect but faithful, the remembrance of the conquering Babylonians and the exile, the remembrance of the words of the prophets who constantly brought the people back with a dream and a course correction. It was also born of her real experience of the Roman Empire and its overbearing domination.  This is the origin story of Jesus.\nTo this context, for this dream, Mary said “Yes,” and the scandal began.  Joseph, however, was a faithful man, a kind and thoughtful man, and married Mary anyway.  If we don’t know much about Mary, we know even less about Joseph.  We know that Joseph took that first step into Mary’s dream when he used his power to protect her rather than stone her.  Joseph’s upbringing must have included stories of miraculous births, like Rebekah birthing his namesake Joseph, or Hannah birthing Samuel, and Sarah birthing Abraham.  These stories shaped Joseph into one who would create space within his heart and community for Mary to birth Jesus.  This is from whom Jesus comes.\nThe question this Christmas, as it is the question for every Christmas, is the extent to which we will let this Christmas story be a part of our shaping, whether or not we will let this story be a definitive part of our birthing, becoming, being.  Our origin.\nThere was a time in my young adult years, after I had attended Sunday school and Youth group and countless worship services, during most of which I was bored, but nevertheless, through osmosis or the grace of God, I still learned the stories that shaped the people of God…after all of this, the time came for me to choose just how much these stories would shape me.  Were they a part of my origin, or were they just stories?  Could the story become real, in me, in us?  Could we, like Mary, answer “yes” to the dream of all things being made right…through us?  Could we, like Joseph use whatever power we have to create space for the dream to be born anew?  Could we stand tall, in our memories of the stories of God, against the powers that demean, oppress, even kill?\nJesus was born from these origins.  He did not fail them.  He calls us to do the same.\n~ Rev. Trudy Robinson",

    "comments": "The Birth of the Good Shepherd\nAfter ages of waiting, the heavens finally burst forth with the joyous news that the Savior was born. A powerfully radiant angel of the Lord appeared to shepherds.  Then a multitude of the heavenly host proclaimed:  “Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men.”  Why were the heavens opened to lowly shepherds in fields, rather than to kings in castles, rich men in robes, or learned men in their academies?  \nChrist would later call Himself our shepherd, but not a hireling shepherd who would run from danger:  “I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep.” Jesus knows His sheep.  He calls them by name.  His sheep know His voice and follow Him. (John 10:2-16)  \nAnd when sheep don’t follow, He promises to go out and find those who are lost and carry them back home on His shoulders rejoicing.  Since nobody can say “I need no repentance,” we are all lost sheep until the Savior finds us and puts us on His strong shoulders, carries us home, and heals us. (Luke 15:4-10)  Then we want to follow Him.\nSo, why did angels appear to humble shepherds? Just look at what they did:  They loved and cared for lowly animals, they went to find the Christ, and after they found Him, they spread the good news abroad.  \nMay our Christmas celebrations be more like theirs.  May we seek him out.  May we hear the angel voices and hear His voice.  May we follow Him, our Good Shepherd.  And may we spread the good news abroad!"

    "comments": "Camels, Gold and Light\nIsaiah 60:6  \"Camel caravans will cover your roads,\nyoung camels from Midian and Ephah.\nAll the merchants of Sheba will come,\nbringing gold and incense\nand singing praises to the Lord.\"\nThe coming of the Wise Men to the greet the baby Jesus is not the first time great leaders came from afar to the Holy Land. In the days of Solomon, the Queen of Sheba must have come in a similar manner to see the greatest and wisest king on the planet at the time; and her impression was that what she had heard wasn’t even close to the grandeur she witnessed. Likewise these Magi - a priestly caste from Persia who were known as “King-makers” - recognized the star that announced the great King of the Jews, the one we know as the Messiah, and is foretold in the Isaiah passage above. All this heralding of the wealth of the nations coming with praise to the Lord is a result of the prophesy: “Arise, shine, your light has come!” \nWhat a wonderful prophesy and decree to we who sit in our modern day shadowland. This command to shine is powerful because, Jesus, who is the Light of the world, likewise called us to shine.  He said to those who believed in Him, “you are the Light of the World!”\nNotice that the command in Isaiah does not say “Arise and Reflect the light!” Rather there is a light to shine from within us. \nHow else can that happen unless the Light of the World comes within you and me, and shines through us. \nThe world is hungering for something true and authentic, some light to burst forth in the midst of a confused darkness.  Therefore let us respond to the command:  Get up, arise and shine. \nGod doesn’t make a command he doesn’t empower us to do; therefore my brothers and sisters, this is your time. Arise\nArise!\nThis is the time to shine. \nThe light that has come will never go out.  And that is the source of our light…yours and mine. \nLet it shine. \nThen when the camels carry the kings of the earth to our door, there will be something to show, the Light of the World, Jesus. \nLet your light shine before men that your deeds may glorify the Father in Heaven."
